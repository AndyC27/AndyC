Instructions:
Run the program.
Enter the keyword when prompted.
Enter the plaintext when prompted.
The program will output the encrypted and decrypted texts.


Project Description:
This program implements the Vigenere cipher, a polyalphabetic substitution method renowned for its enhanced security over classical ciphers. The program employs an object-oriented approach, encapsulating encryption and decryption logic within the VigenereCipher class. Modular arithmetic is utilized to handle cyclic shifts, ensuring the keyword's repeated application for longer plaintext inputs. User interaction occurs through the console, with the program prompting for a keyword and accommodating multi-word plaintext input. Upon execution, the program displays both the encrypted and decrypted versions of the entered text, providing users with a tangible demonstration of the Vigenere cipher's functionality.

Programming Approaches:
The program follows an object-oriented approach, utilizing a class (VigenereCipher) to encapsulate the encryption and decryption methods. It leverages C++ standard libraries for input/output and string manipulation. The logic involves iterating through the plaintext or ciphertext, applying modular arithmetic to handle shifts based on the provided keyword.
